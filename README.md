# Local-Issues-Reporter
Potholes, broken streetlights, garbage dumps, and illegal constructions often go unreported.
Even when reported, authorities ignore them unless they get multiple complaints.
People need a simple way to report and track local issues.
ðŸ’¡ Solution:
 A community-driven platform where:
 âœ… Citizens can report local issues by uploading photos & details.
 
 âœ… Other users can upvote issues to bring attention.
 
 âœ… Users can track progress updates from local authorities.
 
 âœ… A heatmap highlights areas with the most complaints.
